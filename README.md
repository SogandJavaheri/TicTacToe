# TicTacToe
# Tic Tac Toe â€“ Java OOP Console Game

## ðŸŽ® Overview  
This is a **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in Java using an **object-oriented design**. The game is played in the console and includes full turn-based logic, board rendering, win/draw detection, and clean code structure with multiple classes.

It's designed to demonstrate practical OOP principles such as **encapsulation**, **class responsibilities**, and **modularity**, making it a solid example of clean and maintainable Java code.
